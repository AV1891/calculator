# calculator
This netbeans project  can perform all simple and basic functions for a calculator. The numbers are assigned to a button and are set with their values to be used on a text field. The numbers also have a if-else statement in its source code so that when a new number or sign is added, it would not just empty the text field, but instead add that to the same text field. The calculator can utlize addition, subtraction, multiplaction and division, all for single digits. When making the code for these signs, you create a button to intilize it and  you assign it a String name. You can also save and delete your outputs using M+, MR, and MC.
